# Client Dapp

## Functionality
The user can search over (MMR / ARCHIVE) nodes using Maxima for any coins, addresses, tokenid, and other parameters.
- Once the petition is sent, the results are delivered over Maxima to a networkâ€™s node, and the response also comes back over Maxima and is shown on the screen.
- The first time the dapp must wait maybe for about three minutes until an MMR/ARCHIVE node publishes or modifies its data on the network script.

## Install
Zip the client content folder (only the content; the folder itself must not be included in the zip). Install this zip dapp file into any Minima node, launch the dapp, and start searching blockchain info.
- Install the zip client file on your minima node, if it is running on the same machine that your Mega MMR node then start the node with the following command:
  - **java -jar minima-1.0.41.16.jar -data minimadev -port 10001 -mdsenable -mdspassword 12345678**
## Note
This is only a proof of concept and it still needs work to be a finished dapp.
