# Maxima-Network-MMR-Archive
A network of Archive and Mega MMR nodes operates over the Maxima layer of the fully decentralized Minima blockchain. This network does not require any node (Archive or MMR) to have a public IP, enabling any dapp to request blockchain information (coins, addresses, balances, tokens) or future services without external IP dependencies.
